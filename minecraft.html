  <div>Goals for my Minecraft survival world</div>
  <details>
    <summary>An excessive amount of automated farms</summary>

  <details>
    <summary>Also some not-so-automated farms</summary>
    <ul>
      <!-- TODO: -->
    </ul>
  </details>
  <div>Aquarium - all the tropical fish I can get</div>
  <div>Zoo - literally every mob, passive and hostile (can't wait to figure out how to contain an Enderman...)</div>
  <div>Block/item museum - every block and item in the game, displayed in glass cases</div>
  <div>Note block songs all over - aquarium, zoo, museum, and anywhere else that it makes sense and is cool</div>
  <div>Collect every music disc - if Mojang ever adds more redstone interactivity with jukeboxes, will also make a disc changer</div>
  <div>Map art - no specific ideas yet but as they come they will be listed here (suggestions in stream chat also welcome!)</div>
  <div>The Village Project</div>
  <div>Three Biomes, Three Villages</div>
  <ul>
    <li>At least one shop for each profession</li>
    <li>A house for every villager (maybe some as families, haven't decided on that)</li>
    <li>Fully connected by paths</li>
    <li>Following a bit of a progression of modernity as much as possible, also seen in progression of personal storage system in each village</li>
  </ul>
  <div>Jungle village: primitive build style. Huts, lots of stone brick and wood. Temple on hill overlooking bay. Slightly anachronistic library containing one of every book trade (highest levels only). Personal base: hut similar to villager residences, but with decent size underground storage (manual placement in chests)</div>
  <div>Snowy tundra village: early modern build style (think 1850s-1900s, Victorian-ish). Proper houses, bricks, street lamps, cobble streets, etc. Large factory for some automated farms. Large greenhouses for mass production of wheat, carrots, potatoes, adn beetroots. Personal base: large Victorian house (or small mansion?). Basic item sorting system (one item per column of chests).</div>
  <div>Desert village: futuristic build style. Concrete, iron blocks, futuristic skyscrapers, underground labs. Lots of redstone doors, elevators, flying machines, etc.Main large-scale project TBD. Personal base: TBD, but with the fanciest sorting system I currently know of</div>
  <div>Bonus village, once all three villages feel complete! Underwater village of glass domes, use of prismarine, all connected by glass tunnels. No solid plans yet, since the main three villages for this project all come first.</div>
